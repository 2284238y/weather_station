# Team 2 - Weather Stration

This real-time local weather station project utilises a Raspberry Pi 3, off-the-shelf I2C sensors, a custom built PCB and a graphical display unit (a computer in this situation). The data acquisition, data processing and GUI is all coded in c++ and the web app display runs on an Apache server (on the Raspberry Pi) and is coded in PHP, using a MySQL database. Communication between c++ and PHP is done using the UDP protocol.

Team members:
Aurelie Crawford, Craig McCallum, Damir Gulamov
